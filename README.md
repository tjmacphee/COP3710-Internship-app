# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official django installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/install/#installing-official-release)

Required for Installation:

    Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    PIP (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
    MYSQL (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
    MYSQL Workbench (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) - click the 'download' button, don't click the recommended link

***Note*** : You can quickly clone the project using the github desktop feature. Visit the link to learn more about that process. [Official Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)

Setup your MYSQL & MYSQL Workbench instances. If you set a password for your database, please remember it as it is unchangeable if you forget it.

After getting MYSQL working, create a new database inside the query window, it should look like this:
